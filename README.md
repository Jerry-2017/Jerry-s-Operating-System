From device driver to game, I alone implements the basic File system , Process & Threads & Lock Modules, Device Driver Module (Keyboard ,Timer ,Display ,Hard Disk), Kernel Module (System Call Interface, Interface to Device Driver). And a additional Puzzle Game is provided. At last, a Shell is provided as the user interface. While many bugs existed, the program is tested under Ubuntu 16.04LTM ,gcc 5.1, qemu-i386. A nasm and ImagePick is required for assembly codes and Image converting.

The project is done as a course project for Operating System. And the version I provided is a shell version.
(The game is under /game/game-real.c, you may replace game.c by it and some modification is needed if you want to play the game for the game is for the earliest version of the kernel and itâ€™s updated after)
Some known bugs including Ctrl-c for shell not properly work.
